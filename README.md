# Hello, I'm Arun ðŸ‘‹

As a startup entrepreneur, I wear many different hats and am involved in several aspects of business growth, digitization, and product creation. One of the most important aspects of my work is developing technology that not only saves people money, but also helps promote a more sustainable future by improving the way we use energy.

I believe that learning should be a lifelong pursuit, and this philosophy has allowed me to continuously grow and succeed in my career.

I am proud to say that my latest project, Xoptimus, is being developed in an environmentally friendly way that benefits not only the planet, but also our users. We believe in doing good for the world while also making life easier and more convenient for our customers.
